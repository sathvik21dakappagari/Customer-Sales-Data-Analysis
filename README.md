E-Commerce Sales Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a Kaggle dataset containing over 10,000 e-commerce transactions. The objective was to extract meaningful insights into sales and profit trends, exploring both categorical and seasonal dimensions. The project spans data cleaning, querying, and visualization, ultimately creating an interactive Tableau dashboard for accessible insights.

Project Overview

	•	Data Cleaning: Utilized Microsoft Excel to clean and prepare the dataset, ensuring accuracy and consistency across 10,000+ records.
	•	Data Analysis: Queried the cleaned dataset using PostgreSQL to uncover categorical and seasonal patterns in sales and profits.
	•	Data Visualization: Designed an interactive dashboard in Tableau, displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends in sales for enhanced accessibility.

Features

	•	Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and redundant data using Excel.
	•	SQL Querying: Executed SQL queries to explore and analyze data, focusing on:
	•	Sales and profit distribution across product categories.
	•	Seasonal trends and patterns in customer transactions.
	•	Interactive Dashboard: Created a Tableau dashboard that visualizes KPIs, allowing users to explore:
	•	Sales and profit trends by product category and season.
	•	Key insights into peak sales periods and top-performing categories.

Tools Used

	•	Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and preparation.
	•	PostgreSQL for querying and analyzing the dataset.
	•	Tableau for creating an interactive dashboard.

Getting Started

To replicate or explore this project:

	1.	Dataset: Download the e-commerce dataset from Kaggle (link here if available).
	2.	Data Cleaning: Follow data cleaning steps in Excel as outlined in the data_cleaning_steps.xlsx.
	3.	Database Setup: Import the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL (sample schema provided).
	4.	SQL Analysis: Use provided SQL scripts (queries.sql) to perform data analysis.

Results

Key insights from the project include:

	•	Identification of top product categories contributing to overall sales and profit.
	•	Insights into sales patterns by season and month.
	•	Key performance metrics visualized on an accessible Tableau dashboard.

Project Structure

	•	data_cleaning_steps.xlsx: Document with data cleaning steps performed in Excel.
	•	queries.sql: SQL scripts for querying and analyzing the dataset.
	•	ecommerce_dashboard.twbx: Tableau dashboard visualizing KPIs and trends.

Future Improvements

	•	Integrate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
	•	Develop machine learning models to predict future sales trends.
	•	Enhance the dashboard with real-time data capabilities.
